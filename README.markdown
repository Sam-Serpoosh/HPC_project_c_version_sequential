## Smith-Waterman Similarity Matrix Calculator

Here we we're doing a sequential approach for calculating the simialrity matrix in the Smith-Waterman algorithm! Which you can read about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm)

The result of timing this sequential approach running 100 times repeatedly is
as following:

# Total Time --> 2.973s
